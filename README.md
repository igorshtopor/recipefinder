# recipefinder
Project

A recipe finder app using the RecipePuppy API: http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/ 

Requirements

As the user types in a search query for the name of a recipe, search results should be displayed in a list (i.e. as the user types, the list may update).
The first 20 results of a search must be displayed. 
Notes
You may use a Ruby framework, such as Rails if it suits.
Please do not use a full blown Javascript framework; use only the Javascript required to achieve a robust list-update.
You may decide on the structure and style of the application.
The UI is very simple, but still consider devices such a mobile. 
Assessment criteria

How well the requirements above are met.
Code quality.
The simplicity and extensibility of the approach taken.
Ability to solve unexpected problems, and how those are documented.
