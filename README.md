# recipefinder
Project

A recipe finder app using the RecipePuppy API: http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/ 

Requirements

  * As the user types in a search query for the name of a recipe, search results should be displayed in a list (i.e. as the user types, the list may update).
  * The first 20 results of a search must be displayed. 
Notes
  * You may use a Ruby framework, such as Rails if it suits.
  * Please do not use a full blown Javascript framework; use only the Javascript required to achieve a robust list-update.
  * You may decide on the structure and style of the application.
  * The UI is very simple, but still consider devices such a mobile. 
Assessment criteria

1. How well the requirements above are met.
2. Code quality.
3. The simplicity and extensibility of the approach taken.
4. Ability to solve unexpected problems, and how those are documented.
